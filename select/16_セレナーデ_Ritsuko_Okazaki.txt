Hajimete no takara mono yo
You are my first treasure
Konna nimo suki ni natte
I love you that much
Tsuyoku te yowai kokoro
Although my strong yet weak heart
Toki ni wa subishi garu kedo
Gets lonsome occasionally
Kimi ga warsru to sore dakede mou ureshikute
Your smile alone makes me happy
Subete ga sora wo mi age teru
And it makes everything okay
Utsu muite ta hi wa koko kara might ta no wa nukarumi
I was looking down every day, down into the mud
Demo ima wa sora wo mi age teru
But, I am looking up at the sky now
Tohou ni kureru senaka ni
I wish I could say something
Kotoba wo kake tai kedo
to your troubled and anguished back
Dosha buri ni nurereta kaya wo
Right away, I want to embrace your shoulders
Sugu nimo daki tai keredo
That are soaked with pouring rain
Itsu mo itsu demo motomete ite kure nakute ii
It's alright that you don't seek me always and anytime
Don na hi mo kimi wo shitteru
I know you any day
Kokoro no kagi wo akeru no wa tsuyoi chikara jya naku
The key that will open your heart is not a strong power
Massugu omou Kimochi
It is made of strait forward feelings
Kimi ga warau to sore dakede mou ureshikute
Your smile alone makes me happy
Subete ga muku warerun
And it makes everything okay
Utsu muite ta hi wa koko kara might ta no wa nukarumi
I was looking down every day, down into the mud
Demo ima wa sora wo mi age teru
But, I am looking up at the sky now
Kyou mo ganbarou makenai tsuyosa wo motou
I shall do my best again today. Let's gain the strength not to be defeated
Aisuru hito no tame nimo
For the sake of the person whom I love
